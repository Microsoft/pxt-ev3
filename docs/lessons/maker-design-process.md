# The LEGO Education Maker (Design) Process

## Defining the Problem

It is important that students define a real problem to solve, or find a new design opportunity from the start. The “Connect” images are provided to help students think about designing their solutions. At this stage of the process, it is important that you not show examples of a final or sample solution. 

## Brainstorm

Brainstorming is an active part of making. Some students will find it easier to explore their thoughts through tinkering (hands-on experimentation) with the LEGO bricks, and others will prefer to record sketches and notes. Group work is essential, but it is important to allow time for students to work alone before sharing their ideas with their groups.

## Define the Design Criteria

Discussing and reaching an agreement about the best solution to build can involve a lot of negotiation and may require different techniques that are dependent on the students’ skills. For example:

* Some students draw well.
* Others may build part of a model, and then describe what they mean.
* Other students may be good at describing a strategy.

Encourage an ethos where students can share anything, no matter how abstract it might sound. Be active during this phase and ensure that the ideas the students choose are achievable.

It is important that students set clear design criteria. Once the solution to the problem has been made, the students will return to these criteria, which will then form the basis for testing how well their solution works.
Go Make Students must make one of their ideas using the LEGO® set, and can use other materials if needed. If they are finding it hard to build their idea, encourage them to break problems down into smaller parts. Explain that they do not have to come up with the whole solution from the start. Remind students that this process is iterative and they must test, analyze, and revise their idea as they go.
Using this Maker process does not mean you are following an inflexible set of steps. Instead, think of it as a set of practices.
For example, brainstorming may be prominent at the beginning of the process. However, students may also need to brainstorm ideas when they are trying to figure out ways to improve their idea, or when they have a bad test result and must change a feature of their design.
Review and Revise Your Solution To help students develop their critical thinking and communication skills, you may wish to have students from one group observe and critique another group’s solution. Peer review and formative feedback helps both the students giving, and the students receiving the feedback to improve their work.
Communicate Your Solution The Student Worksheet is helpful for basic documentation of the activity. Students can also refer to it when presenting their work in front of the class. You may also wish to use the Student Worksheet as a portfolio for performance evaluations or for student self-evaluation.
