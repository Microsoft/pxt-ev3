## Step 1

Open the ``||brick:Brick||`` Toolbox drawer. From the **Screen** section, drag out a ``||brick:show string||`` block onto the Workspace, and drop it into the ``||loops:on start||`` block. You should hear and see the block click into place.

```block
brick.showString("Hello world", 1)
```

## Step 2

In the ``||brick:show string||`` block, type the text ``"Press my buttons to make music!"`` to replace ``"Hello world"``.

```block
brick.showString("Press my buttons to make music!", 1)
```

# Step 3

Open the ``||brick:Brick||`` Toolbox drawer. From the **Buttons** section, drag out an ``||brick:on button||`` block onto the Workspace (you can put it anywhere).

```block
brick.buttonEnter.onEvent(ButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {

})
brick.showString("Press my buttons to make music!", 1)
```

## Step 4

Open the ``||music:Music||`` Toolbox drawer. Drag out **5** ``||music:play tone||`` blocks onto the Workspace, and drop them into the ``||brick:on button||`` block. **Note:** you can also right-click on a block and select "Duplicate" to copy blocks.

```block
brick.buttonEnter.onEvent(ButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {
    music.playTone(0, music.beat(BeatFraction.Half))
    music.playTone(0, music.beat(BeatFraction.Half))
    music.playTone(0, music.beat(BeatFraction.Half))
    music.playTone(0, music.beat(BeatFraction.Half))
    music.playTone(0, music.beat(BeatFraction.Half))
})
brick.showString("Press my buttons to make music!", 1) 
```

## Step 5

In the ``||music:play tone||`` blocks, use the drop-down menu to select a note to play for each block.  You can also set the duration to play each note for.

```block
brick.buttonEnter.onEvent(ButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {
    music.playTone(440, music.beat(BeatFraction.Half))
    music.playTone(494, music.beat(BeatFraction.Half))
    music.playTone(392, music.beat(BeatFraction.Half))
    music.playTone(196, music.beat(BeatFraction.Half))
    music.playTone(294, music.beat(BeatFraction.Whole))
})
brick.showString("Press my buttons to make music!", 1)
```

## Step 6

Now, letâ€™s download our program to the brick. Plug your EV3 brick into the computer with the USB cable, and click the blue **Download** button in the bottom left of your screen. Follow the directions to save your program to the brick. You can add more ``||brick:on button||`` blocks to the Workspace and create other ``||music:play tone||`` melodies when different buttons are pressed to transform your Mindstorms brick into a musical instrument!
