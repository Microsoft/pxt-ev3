# Troubleshooting download problems

If your're having trouble getting your code onto the @boardname@, try these steps to see if you can fix the problem.

## Can I see the LEGO drive on my computer?

When your @boardname@ is connected to your computer, you should see a new drive called **LEGO** attached.

On Windows, it looks like this in Explorer:

If you don't see the **LEGO** drive, make sure your brick is powered on and check that your USB connection is good.

## Is my brick charged and powered on?

Make sure your brick is charged and powered on. If your brick doesn't turn on, find the charger and plug it into wall power, then connect it to your brick. Does it turn on and start up?

## Is my USB connection good?

Make sure that one end of your USB cable is firmly inserted into the port on the computer and the other end is connected to the brick. If you still can't see the **LEGO** drive, try a different port on the computer. If that doesn't work then maybe your cable is bad or you need to reset the brick.

## How do I reset my brick?

If you think your USB connection is good and you still can't see your **LEGO** drive, try giving the brick a reset. You can follow these steps to reset:

1. Using a finger from one hand, press the **Back** button. Keep holding it.
2. With your other hand, use two fingers to hold down both the **Left** button and the **Enter** button. You hold these at the same time while your still pressing the **Back** button.
3. Now, release your finger from the **Back** button.
4. When the brick says "Starting..." you can let go of the **Left** an **Enter** buttons.
